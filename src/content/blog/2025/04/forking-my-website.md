title: Forking this website
slug: forking-my-website
description: I love keeping my site open source, and you’re welcome to use the code for your own project — with proper attribution. That said, I’ve put a significant amount of time and care into designing and building this version of the site, so I’d appreciate it if you didn’t claim the work as your own.

## Attribution Guidelines

If you’re using the code **without making major changes** to the structure or design, I kindly ask that you include a visible credit. Here’s an example you can drop into your project:

```html
<a href="https://mvlanga.com" class="transition-colors hover:text-purple-300 light:hover:text-purple-500">
    Designed & developed by mvlanga.com
</a>
```

Or if you've forked the project with **major modifications**, feel free to use this instead:

```html
<a href="https://mvlanga.com" class="transition-colors hover:text-purple-300 light:hover:text-purple-500">
    Forked from mvlanga.com
</a>
```

Please make sure this attribution appears in f. ex. the **footer**.

## A Quick Note

This site wasn’t created as a starter theme, so I may not be able to offer support for implementation questions. For technical help, please refer to the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build).
