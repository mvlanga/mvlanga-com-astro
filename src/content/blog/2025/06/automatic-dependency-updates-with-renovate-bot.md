Setting Renovate Bot up is usually pretty easy, you either use the saas variant and just give it access to you repositories or you choose to self host the Renovate Bot. For all of the basic setup, there are many good tutorials and good documentation.

The challenging part is to give the Renovate Bot access to your private registry (No matter what kind of dependency you wanna store in that registry, f. ex. `npm` or `maven`)
