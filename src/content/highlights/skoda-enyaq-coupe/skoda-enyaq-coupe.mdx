    ## The story

    Due to the rising infection levels (COVID) in the Czech Republic we could not hold a live event with
    journalists,
    therefore planned a purely digital world premiere. This consisted of a world premiere livestream and a Virtual
    Event
    platform we had been using and developing since 2020. For the 3D environment, we created a fictional movie
    theater
    around a movie set where the World Premiere pre-show was filmed. The implementation of the Virtual Event
    happened in
    under 4 weeks.

    ## World Premiere

    The actual world premiere took place via livestream. Users who were online during the show were automatically
    redirected to a page that embedded the YouTube livestream. No active user of the site could miss the event. The
    entire system was based on a remote configuration that could update the status of the application for all users
    in real time.
