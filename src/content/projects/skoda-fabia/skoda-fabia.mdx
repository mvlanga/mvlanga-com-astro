    ## The story

    Due to rising infection rates (COVID) in the Czech Republic, we were unable to hold a live event with
    journalists as planned, so we created a purely digital world premiere. Consisting of a pre-recorded livestream
    and the virtual event platform we had been using and developing since 2020 which had already been successfully
    used for several world premieres. For the 3D environment we chose a replica of the film set where the car
    release was shot, the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague. The entire implementation of the virtual event
    took less than 2 months.

    ## World Premiere

    The actual world premiere took place via livestream. Users who were online during the show were automatically
    redirected to a page that embedded the YouTube livestream. No active user of the site could miss the event. The
    entire system was based on a remote configuration that could update the status of the application for all users
    in real time.
