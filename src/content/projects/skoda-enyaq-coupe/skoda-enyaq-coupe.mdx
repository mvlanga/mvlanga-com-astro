        # The story

        Due to the rising infection levels (COVID) in the Czech Republic we could not hold a live event with
        journalists,
        therefore planned a purely digital world premiere. This consisted of a world premiere livestream and a Virtual
        Event
        platform we had been using and developing since 2020. For the 3D environment, we created a fictional movie
        theater
        around a movie set where the World Premiere pre-show was filmed. The implementation of the Virtual Event
        happened in
        under 4 weeks.

        # World Premiere

        The actual world premiere took place via livestream. Users who were online during the show were automatically
        redirected to a page that embedded the YouTube livestream. No active user of the site could miss the event. The
        entire system was based on a remote configuration that could update the status of the application for all users
        in real time.

        # Highlights

        In addition to the livestream and other video clips such as the making-of of the world premiere, we offered
        multiple
        features such as two mini-games, a seat selection function and camera transitions between the different 3D
        environments.
