    ## The story

    Due to the rising infection levels (COVID) in the Czech Republic we could not hold a live event with journalists, therefore planned a purely digital world premiere. This consisted of a world premiere livestream and a Virtual Event platform we had been using and developing since 2020. For the 3D environment, we created a fictional movie theater around a movie set where the World Premiere pre-show was filmed. The implementation of the Virtual Event happened in under 4 weeks.
