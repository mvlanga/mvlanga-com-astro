    ## The goal

    Fujitsu's services are often very complex and many potential customers lack concrete examples of how they can
    benefit from Fujitsu. Our exhibit and the city it contained showed visitors examples, partly from the personal
    perspective of a fictional protagonist. In Story 2, we explain how Fujitsu can help a company manufacture and
    distribute customized products as efficiently and quickly as possible by optimizing ordering, delivery and
    production processes. Story 3 is about urban infrastructures. More specifically, how Fujitsu optimizes traffic
    flows in private and public sectors. In Story 4, we showed how Fujitsu can help a company with digitalization.
    Digitalization helps companies with automatically and meaningfully analyzing data and optimizing processes to
    sort through immense amounts of information. Visitors to the Fujitsu Forum were able to select and play a story
    of their choice on a tablet at any time.
