    # The story

    In order to make the event an experience not only for visitors to the IAA 2021, we digitally reproduced the
    physical trade fair 1:1. In addition to various areas such as the HR or Quiz Corner, there was a live format in
    which talks were broadcast via livestream. Here, topics such as the importance of AI in the automotive industry
    were discussed. The press conference was broadcast this way as well. The entire implementation of the virtual
    trade fair booth was completed in less than 6 weeks.

    # Live Sessions

    During the entire IAA, 7 different topics were broadcast live from the stage of the CARIAD booth. In addition to
    a classic livestream on all social media channels, visitors had the opportunity to access a 360Â° camera on stage
    to get a more immersive feel. We also installed a display showing real-time viewer numbers.

    # Highlights

    In addition to the booth and information about CARIAD, we offered many other features, such as the Quiz Corner,
    where you could create your own CARIAD wallpaper and take part in a raffle after successfully completing the
    quiz. In the HR corner, guests could read about working at CARIAD and all open positions. This, as well as the
    CARIAD experience developed by an external service provider, was presented at our booth as well as onsite. Last
    but not least, we had the Board Talk area where you could ask the management questions in a pre-recorded
    interview.
