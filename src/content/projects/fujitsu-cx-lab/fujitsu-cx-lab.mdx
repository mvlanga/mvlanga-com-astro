        # The origin: Our Smart City exhibit at the Fujitsu Forum 2019

        Explaining products and services in a simplified way using a digital city comes from an idea we had during a
        previous project with Fujitsu. With our Smart City exhibit, we explained services to Fujitsu Forum 2019 visitors
        through beamer projections on a 150 cm high model city using personal examples.

        # The goals

        Fujitsu's services are often very complex and many potential customers have no concrete examples of how they can
        benefit from Fujitsu. Our goal was to explain the Smart City not only to visitors of the Fujitsu Forum but to
        anyone interested via special calls. Within this platform, the presenter has the option to choose between
        different stories. After selecting, the visitor is experiencing a linear storyline. Here he can switch from the
        starting point, the Fujitsu Tower, to different parts of the city with camera transitions. In each area, there
        were opportunities to start different presentations and videos. This replaces a typical salespersons standard
        PowerPoint presentation with a unified, expandable presentation platform.

        # Highlights

        In addition to features such as multi-language capability and passwordless e-mail authentication, one had the
        option of uploading the client's logo and own presentations as PDFs when starting a new session. This way, there
        is no break during the call, as everything can be opened directly via the CX Lab interface. Another highlight is
        the self-developed presentation component, which provides the most common Power Point tools and shortcuts.

        Since the Fujitsu CX Lab is an internal application, I can unfortunately not show more pictures and videos at
        this point.
